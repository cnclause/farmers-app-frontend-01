            Our philosophy is simple, we want cannabis cultivators to have a place to turn to for information and meaningful connections. Cannabis cultivation has for a long time remained an illicit market, hidden away in the dark corridors of our society. Because of this, a lot of cultivation techniques have been developed through qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. This means that farmers have been relying heavily on their instincts and advice from other farmers to learn the best way to cultivate this plant. While that may have worked for some, it has made it challenging for a vast majority of new cultivators. At Cannect we hope to end that struggle by taking the already existing model of peer-to-peer cultivation and making it even easier. Not only do we hope to connect cannabis cultivators around the world we also want to provide them with a central location to discover the most current research and data leading the industry. Itâ€™s time to put an end to the invisible barrier blocking the progress of this industry, through scientific research and meaningful conversation.
